        <h2>Dr. Pants</h2>
        <p>Dr. Pants is the resident robotics fanatic of the Nerdstrodamus crew — if it’s 
            got gears, circuits, or a shiny metal chassis, he’s already in love. Whether 
            he’s building them, battling them, or just talking your ear off about why 
            robots are the future, his passion is unmatched. In-game, expect him to 
            gravitate toward anything mechanical… and probably name it.</p>

        <h2>Lambo</h2>
        <p>Lambo is the lovable wildcard of the Nerdstrodamus crew — part chaos engine, 
            part mystery. Nobody’s quite sure if his wild plays are strokes of genius or 
            happy accidents, and he’s not telling. He’s known for clutch saves, 
            questionable strategies, and jokes that hit harder than his headshots. 
            Whatever the game, if Lambo’s in the lobby, something unforgettable is about 
            to happen.</p>

        <h2>Punk</h2>
        <p>Punk is one of Nerdstrodamus’ correspondents and the host of What the Game!, 
            the channel’s anything-goes game show. He mainly games on PC but always keeps 
            his Steam Deck and Switch 2 close for those away-from-the-desk sessions. He’s 
            all about games you can play with friends, but he’ll never say no to a solid 
            single-player story. Expect good vibes, a bit of chaos, and plenty of playful 
            trash talk.</p>

        <h2>Slotad</h2>
        <p>Slotad is the steady hand of the Nerdstrodamus crew — until he’s not. Known for 
          his sharp instincts, dry humor, and occasional streaks of absolute chaos, he’s 
          equally at home pulling off a perfectly timed play or derailing the plan 
          entirely. Whether he’s in it for the win or just for the laughs, Slotad always 
          keeps things interesting.</p>

      <div class="person-text">
        <h2>DAAD</h2>
        <p>DAAD is the unpredictable spark of the Nerdstrodamus crew — always ready to 
          stir things up and keep everyone on their toes. When he’s not bringing chaos 
          to the game, he’s perfecting the art of smoking meat, because nothing pairs 
          with a good match like a slow-cooked masterpiece. Clever plays, offbeat humor, 
          and a little unpredictability make every game with DAAD an adventure.</p>
